# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and deep learning. This project leverages OpenCV and a CNN model to monitor facial landmarks and detect signs of fatigue—such as prolonged eye closure—to help prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.
