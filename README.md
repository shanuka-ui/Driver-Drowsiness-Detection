# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and deep learning. This project leverages OpenCV and a CNN model to monitor facial landmarks and detect signs of fatigue—such as prolonged eye closure—to help prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.

# Features
Real-time video stream processing using webcam

Eye aspect ratio (EAR) calculation for blink and closure detection

Deep learning-based face and eye detection using Haar cascades or Dlib

Alerts driver with visual/audio warnings on detecting drowsiness

Lightweight, fast, and runs on most modern laptops

# Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

Keras/TensorFlow or PyTorch

Dlib or Haar Cascade Classifiers

# Use Case
Designed to enhance road safety by providing timely alerts when signs of driver fatigue are detected. Ideal for integration in vehicle safety systems or driver monitoring apps.
